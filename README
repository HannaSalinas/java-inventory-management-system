# 🛒 Inventory Management System – Java (Academic Project)

**Student:** Hanna Jineth Contreras Salinas  
**Course:** Object-Oriented Programming – IUDigital de Antioquia  

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a console-based inventory management system using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

The system allows the user to:

- Register products
- Display all registered products

- Calculate the total inventory value
- Delete products by code

## 🧩 Technologies and Concepts

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- ArrayList (dynamic data structure)
- Encapsulation and methods
- Console-based UI
- Exception handling (try-catch)
